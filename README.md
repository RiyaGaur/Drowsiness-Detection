# Drowsiness-Detection
Drowsiness detection is a safety technology that can prevent accidents that are caused by drivers who fell asleep while driving.
A countless number of people drive on the highway day and night. Taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers and people traveling long-distance suffer from lack of sleep. Due to which it becomes very dangerous to drive while feeling sleepy.
So, to prevent these accidents we will build a system using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib which will alert the driver when he feels sleepy.
